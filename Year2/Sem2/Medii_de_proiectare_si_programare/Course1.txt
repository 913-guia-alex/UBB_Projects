Open postmen
GET: http://localhost:4300/entity
	-Should return an array/list of my entities
EX:
	[
		{
			id:1,
			a1:vsbi,
			a2:vreg,
			a3:btr,
			a4:aswd,
			a5:bters,
		},
		{
			id:2,
			a1:vcreh,
			a2:nfg,
			a3:asfd,
			a4:ujhgdfg,
			a5:sdghfth
		}

How to write code::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Web App / REST API library from Python
	Django and Django Rest Framework
	install postman to work with API

MVC/MVT(Model View Controller , Model View Template)
	Model -> domain entities and they store the data between the server and the client
	View(Templates in Django) presentation layer and handle user interaction logic
