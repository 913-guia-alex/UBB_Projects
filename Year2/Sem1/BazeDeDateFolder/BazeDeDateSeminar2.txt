Stored procedures :

it is executed like this : EXEC <SPName>

in the database -> programability -> stored procedures (for the template)


example of a easy stored procedure:

CREATE PROCEDURE uspStudentsNames
AS
	SELECT sname
	FROM Students
GO
EXEC uspStudentsNames


you create a procedure like the one above and then
executed with EXEC or EXECUTE


ALTER PROCEDURE uspNameStudents(@age INT) // which means that the procedure uspNameStudents is rewritten as the one below
AS
SELECT sname
FROM Students
WHERE age = @age
GO


EXEC uspNameStudents 20



CREATE PROCEDURE uspNoOfStudents(@age INT , @NoStd INT OUTPUT) //for the thing we want to return
AS						|
	SELECT @NoStd = COUNT(*)		|
	FROM Students				|
	WHERE age = @age			|
GO						|
						|
DECLARE @NoStd INT ----------|			|
SET @NoStd = 0		     v		v--------
EXEC uspNoOfStudents 20 , @NoStd = @NoStd OUTPUT
PRINT @NoStd



RAISERROR ({msg_id|msg_str|@local_val} {,severity_state})

not all parameters are mandatory

EX : ('There are no students of the specified age.' ,10,1)



RAISERROR (N'This is message %s %d.' ,
		10, -- Severity
		1, -- state
		N'number', -- %s string
		10 -- %d int 
	)
-- Will print out -> This is message number 10

select * from students (to see all the fields from the table students)






Dynamic Execution :

EXEC (<command>)

EX : EXEC('SELECT sid , cid FROM Exams WHERE sid ='1') 
     GO   -- we put the statement in the EXEC
